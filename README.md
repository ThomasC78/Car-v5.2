# Car-v5.2
3D printable RC car using two ESP microcontrollers connected with ESP-NOW. One ESP works as a transmitter (controller) and the other as a receiver on the car, allowing fast wireless control without Wi-Fi pairing. Version 5.2 because the project went through many offline hardware, code, and design revisions before being uploaded to GitHub.
