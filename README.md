# Car-v5.2


3D Printable ESP-NOW RC Car

This project is a 3D printable remote-controlled car built using two ESP microcontrollers that communicate with ESP-NOW.

One ESP is used as a transmitter (controller) and sends control data. The second ESP is used as a receiver on the car and controls the motors and steering. ESP-NOW is used for fast and reliable wireless communication without Wi-Fi pairing.

The project starts at version 5.2 because it went through multiple offline hardware, code, and 3D design revisions before being uploaded to GitHub. This repository represents a stable working version.

## Contents

* 3D printable files
* Transmitter ESP code
* Receiver ESP code
* Components required


## Note

I've made this project a long time ago, the code might be an outdated version, I'm not sure. I might have also forgotten to add a couple components in the component list.


Add me on discord for any questions, or something I forgot to add. I'm pretty new to this stuff.
