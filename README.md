# Car-v5.2


3D Printable ESP-NOW RC Car

This project is a 3D printable remote-controlled car built using two ESP microcontrollers that communicate with ESP-NOW.

One ESP is used as a transmitter (controller) and sends control data. The second ESP is used as a receiver on the car and controls the motors and steering. ESP-NOW is used for fast and reliable wireless communication without Wi-Fi pairing.

The project starts at version 5.2 because it went through multiple offline hardware, code, and 3D design revisions before being uploaded to GitHub. This repository represents a stable working version.
